# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would fit my automated tests in Recipe project development pipeline in my Github action because the test can be automated and I do not need to rely on people running the test manually.

2. No, because it is only simulating user actions from start to finish. Unit test can check functions individually and do not rely on other functions to run.

3. No, because sending a 'message' feature require the user to write and send it to another user so using E2E test would be more optimal because it allows us to simulate user input.

4. Yes, because we can try to pass in an input to the function for the feature and we can make the test to return true if the characters is below or equal to 80 and return false if the characters is more than 80.
