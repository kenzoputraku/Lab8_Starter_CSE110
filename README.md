# Lab 8 - Starter

1. I would 'Manually run them locally before pushing code' because it is a very small project and we want to check that the code we made is correct and has no bugs before pushing them.

2. No, because it is only simulating user actions from start to finish.

3. No, because sending a 'message' feature require the user to write and send it to another user so using E2E test would be more optimal because it allows us to simulate user input.

4. Yes, because we can try to pass in an input to the function for the feature and we can make the test to return true if the characters is below or equal to 80 and return false if the characters is more than 80.
